## 1. Overview

### Purpose:

A secure, cross-platform application to upload and view media files (images/videos) over local Wi-Fi. The backend runs on a laptop and only starts on trusted networks. Clients auto-discover the server, authenticate, and interact with the shared storage.

### Goals:

- Fast and secure file sharing within local networks
- Device authentication
- Shared mount support across Linux and Windows
- Developer-friendly (Docker, REST API)
- Open-source and modular

## 3. Core Modules

|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Main App Entry**   | `main.dart`                             | Initializes app, routing, theme                             |
| **Authentication**   | `lib/screens/login_screen.dart`         | Login form + API call to get JWT                            |
|                      | `lib/services/auth_service.dart`        | Handles login, token storage, headers                       |
| **Server Discovery** | `lib/services/discovery_service.dart`   | Uses mDNS to find the server IP                             |
| **API Client**       | `lib/services/api_client.dart`          | Handles all REST API calls (login, upload, list, download)  |
| **Upload**           | `lib/screens/upload_screen.dart`        | UI to pick and upload media files                           |
|                      | `lib/services/file_picker_service.dart` | Abstracts file picking logic                                |
| **Media Listing**    | `lib/screens/home_screen.dart`          | Shows list of uploaded media (GET `/files`)                 |
|                      | `lib/models/file_model.dart`            | Model class for media files                                 |
| **Media Viewer**     | `lib/screens/media_viewer.dart`         | View full image/video using Flutter widgets                 |
| **Config**           | `lib/config.dart`                       | App-level constants (e.g. port, mDNS type, file size limit) |
| **Token Storage**    | `shared_preferences` package            | Securely store JWT token across sessions                    |

## 4. Data Flow

- Client starts and discovers server via mDNS
- Client sends login credentials ‚Üí receives JWT
- Client uploads media files via POST /upload/
- Server saves file to shared mount
- Clients can list and view media from GET /files/

## 5. Endpoints (REST API)

|Method  | Endpoint         | Description              | Auth  |
|--------|------------------|--------------------------|-------|
|`POST`  |`/auth/login`     | Login with credentials   | ‚ùå    |
|`POST`  |`/auth/register`  | Create a new user        | ‚ùå    |
|`GET`   |`/files/`         | List all uploaded files  | ‚úÖ    |
|`POST`  |`/upload/`        | Upload a new file        | ‚úÖ    |
|`GET`   |`/files/{id}`     | Download a file          | ‚úÖ    |

## 6. Security Design

- JWT-based auth with expiry + refresh token support
- Basic password hashing (bcrypt)
- Files saved outside web root (non-public paths)
- Optional: Role-based access (viewer/uploader)

## 7. Local Network Behavior

- On startup, server checks current SSID.
- If SSID is not in whitelist, server exits.
- Otherwise, server launches and advertises via mDNS.
- Clients scan mDNS records for _lanvault._tcp.local. to find IP/port.

## 8. Future Enhancements

- Lossless media compression module
- Thumbnail generation for videos
- Admin panel (web-based)
- Desktop sync client (auto-backup folders)
